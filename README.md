# Opinion Event Selector

## Project Overview

**Opinion Event Selector** is a tool designed to assist researchers and public opinion analysts in evaluating and selecting the best mix of events for their studies. The project aims to provide an automated tool for grouping social events, making it easier to reflect how the public responds to certain brands or how opinions are formed and developed in various online platforms.

### Benchmark and Criteria for a Satisfactory Event Mix

1. **Diversity:** The events should cover as many fields, risk types, and subject entity categories as possible.
2. **Even Popularity Distribution:** The popularity of each event should be evenly distributed to avoid the influence of extremely viral events on the study outcomes, leading to a miscomprehension of opinion distribution and extremity.
3. **Unrelated Events:** The event mix should tend to cover different events that are inherently unrelated to avoid overlap in events and opinion leaders. For example, if event A and B are sub-events of a big event, only one of them should be selected into the mix.
4. **Emotionality Selector and Filter:** The process can be optimized by adding an emotionality selector and filter based on the selection criteria.

## Research and Project Target

The main goal of this project is to provide an automated tool for sociological, communication, information management, and corporate management studies. The selected events should be representative of how the public responds to and evaluates certain brands or how opinions are formed and developed in specific online opinion markets (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Weibo, or WeChat).

## Potential Algorithmic Optimization Directions

1. **Evaluate the Product Mix and Design the Evaluator:** Investigate ways to evaluate the quality of the event mix and design an appropriate evaluator.
2. **Identify Closeness and Familiarities Between Events:** Improve the identification of the closeness and familiarity between events and develop methods to check and test events.
